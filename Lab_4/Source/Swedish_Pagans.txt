The wise woman said:
"Once you're hardened in battle
There's no coming back.
Fight or Fall!"
And before the attack
Feel your blood start to boil in your veins as you charge
Hundreds fallen
As the fire inside
Is ignited by bloodshed
In berserkers from north
Could it be as was said
When the serpent be woken
Fenrir howls
Swedish Pagans, marching ashore
Forged in Valhalla by the hammer of Thor
Out from Asgard, a viking ship sails
Never to turn back again!
Where our brothers have fought
Is where we will be proven
On ground stained by blood
Standing tall!
And we know, if we fall
Our comrades awaits in Valhall
Odin's calling!
As the fire inside
Is ignited by bloodshed
In berserkers from north
Could it be as was said
When the serpent be woken
Fenrir howls
Swedish Pagans, marching ashore
Forged in Valhalla by the hammer of Thor
Out from Asgard, a viking ship sails
Never to turn back again!
First to the battle
First to the feast
Destiny waiting,
No retreat,
Retreat!
Swedish Pagans, marching ashore
Forged in Valhalla by the hammer of Thor
Out from Asgard, a viking ship sails
Never to turn back again!
